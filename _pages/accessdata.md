# Under Construction
# Caveats
### Our data is split into fixed site versus random site surveys. 
Our random sites follow a stratified-random sampling design (StRS), meaning they can only be meaningfully analyzed at island and regional levels.

# Download raw data via NCEI
Our raw data is archived with NCEI within Collections, and is described with the InPort metadata catalog.

# Access R processing scripts
Our data is still being converted into public-ready form and will become available on PIFSC github

# Download SfM imagery Google Cloud bucket (NODD)
For assistance and tools on how to adopt a similar strategy at your institution, contact the Data Services Team at [email here]
